The Fizzbuzz Repo!
By Gil Goldman

If I can't write a decent fizzbuzz in a language, do I really know it?
This repo will hold at least a fizzbuzz in every langauge I claim to know.

Most of these will not be compiled executables to make it easier
to examine. Also, while it is possible to write better FizzBuzzes
in most cases (Such as in the Python FizzBuzz, which can be written
in a single line), I opted for clarity whenever relevant and 
performance was not impacted.
